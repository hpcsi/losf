LosF: A Linux operating system Framework for managing HPC clusters
-------------------------------------------------------------------

LosF is intended to be a lightweight configuration management system
designed for use with high-performance computing (HPC) clusters.
Target users for this package are HPC system administrators and system
architects who desire flexible command-line utilities for
synchronizing hosts across a cluster. Based on keyword-driven
configuration files, cluster hosts can be organized into different
node types (e.g. login, compute, file-system servers, etc), and each
node type maintains it's own configuration. Typical synchronization
capabilities and features provided by LosF on HPC clusters include:

* kickstart provisioning files (for use with Cobbler)
* host configuration files
* runtime services
* runtime service subscriptions
* file permissions
* soft links
* OS packages from distros (RPM based)
* custom 3rd party HPC packages (RPM based)
* historical host logging (beta, still under development)

There are three primary top-level command line utilities provided by LosF:

* losf      -> configuration for package management, node provisioning, and logging
* update    -> utility to bring local host in sync with current s/w configuration
* koomie_cf -> parallel ssh tool

To use these tools (and other ancillary utilities), configuration
files are required to be provided on a per-cluster basis to define
node type designations based on hostname regular expressions, and to
provide templates for desired configuration files. 

LosF is currently designed to work with Cobbler for bare-metal
provisioning. See the companion INSTALL file for more information on
software requirements to use LosF and Cobbler.
