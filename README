LosF: A Linux operating system Framework for managing HPC clusters
-------------------------------------------------------------------

LosF is intended to be a lightweight configuration management system
designed for use with high-performance computing (HPC) clusters.
Target users for the package are HPC system administrators and system
architects who desire flexible command-line utilities for
synchronizing hosts across a cluster. Based on keyword-driven
configuration files, cluster hosts can be organized into different
node types (e.g. login, compute, file-system servers, etc), and each
node type maintains it's own configuration. Typical synchronization
capabilities and features provided by LosF on HPC clusters include:

* kickstart provisioning files (for use with Cobbler)
* host configuration files
* runtime services
* file permissions
* soft links
* OS packages from distros (RPM based)
* custom 3rd party HPC packages (RPM based)
* historical host logs

There are three primary top-level command line utilities provided by LosF:

* losf   -> configuration for package management, node provisioning, and logging
* update -> utility to bring local host in sync with current s/w configuration
* koomie -> parallel ssh tool

To use these tools (and other ancillary utilities), configuration
files are required to be provided on a per-cluster basis to define
node type designations based on hostname regular expressions, and to
provide templates for desired configuration files. 

See the INSTALL file for more information on software requirements to
use LosF.
